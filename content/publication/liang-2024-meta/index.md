abstract: Fairness of artificial intelligence and machine learning models, often caused
  by imbalanced datasets, has long been a concern. While many efforts aim to minimize
  model bias, this study suggests that traditional fairness evaluation methods may
  be biased, highlighting the need for a proper evaluation scheme with multiple evaluation
  metrics due to varying results under different criteria. Moreover, the limited data
  size of minority groups introduces significant data uncertainty, which can undermine
  the judgement of fairness. This paper introduces an innovative evaluation approach
  that estimates data uncertainty in minority groups through bootstrapping from majority
  groups for a more objective statistical assessment. Extensive experiments reveal
  that traditional evaluation methods might have drawn inaccurate conclusions about
  model fairness. The proposed method delivers an unbiased fairness assessment by
  adeptly addressing the inherent complications of model evaluation on imbalanced
  datasets. The results show that such comprehensive evaluation can provide more confidence
  when adopting those models.
