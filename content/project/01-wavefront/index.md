This project was done during my junior and senior years at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), co-advised by Professor Xiaoye Xu of the CAS Key Laboratory of Quantum Information and Professor Zhiwei Xiong of the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science. Base on this project, my B.Sc. thesis was recognized as an outstanding thesis of USTC for the year of 2022.
