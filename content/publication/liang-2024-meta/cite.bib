 abstract = {Fairness of artificial intelligence and machine learning models, often caused by imbalanced datasets, has long been a concern. While many efforts aim to minimize model bias, this study suggests that traditional fairness evaluation methods may be biased, highlighting the need for a proper evaluation scheme with multiple evaluation metrics due to varying results under different criteria. Moreover, the limited data size of minority groups introduces significant data uncertainty, which can undermine the judgement of fairness. This paper introduces an innovative evaluation approach that estimates data uncertainty in minority groups through bootstrapping from majority groups for a more objective statistical assessment. Extensive experiments reveal that traditional evaluation methods might have drawn inaccurate conclusions about model fairness. The proposed method delivers an unbiased fairness assessment by adeptly addressing the inherent complications of model evaluation on imbalanced datasets. The results show that such comprehensive evaluation can provide more confidence when adopting those models.},
